# blewis (working title)

A redis alternative with some niceties.

# The goals 

1) Replacing RESP
    The first goal is to replace the Redis SErialization Protocol (RESP)[https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/] 
    with a _true_ binary protocol. The main reason for this is because I find protocols with a delimiter between fields 
    innefficient when compared with protocols where the encoding is properly specified. My original plan was to build a 
    protocol from the ground up to meet my usecase but since I've done that before I know how large a project that piece
    *alone* is, and the rest of this project is sizeable enough already, I want to use ASN.1. 

    The main reason I selected ASN.1 is mostly just so that I can learn it. I'm thinking of using the Distinguised 
    Encoding Rules (DER) or Packed Encoding Rules (PER) for the serialization format, as they're well established. 
    DER is the most likely candidate due to ease of implementation, though I did see a newcomer sugggested in a 
    whitepaper: EPER Extended Packed Encoding Rules, which seems to address a lot of the traditional concerns with PER.
    The whitepaper can be found (here)[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35079-0_11.pdf].

    Another reason I chose ASN.1 is because it will allow me to change the encoding scheme at a later date relatively 
    painlessly, and it also allows for ease of implementation in other languages, if I so choose. 

    I'm not sure whether I'm going to just use a library for this, or whether I'm going to implement this from the ground
    up myself. I'm leaning towards library to start, then _maybe_ implement it myself later, especiallly if I want to try 
    that new encoding method.

2) Using lock-free data structures for speedy-quick, safe concurrency.
    I want to use lock-free data structures for concurrency, as opposed to mutexes. Redis' codebase is littered with 
    mutexes **which is fine** but I want to try and better understand lock-free data structures, as this is something 
    that has been on my list of things to learn for a while. I *believe* that I may be able to get *some* performance
    speed ups in *some* cases. Even if not, I just want to _truly_ understand lock-free programming. 

3) Support TCP, UDP, unix sockets and HTTP and web sockets out of the box. 
    RESP could _theoretically_ support UDP but it doesn't. It could also _theoretically_ support HTTP but it doesn't.
    The main reasons I want to adopt all of the above are: 1) I want to further develop my skills writing UDP 
    applications 2) It's not a massive stretch to go from TCP to unix sockets. 3) HTTP is super easy. 4) Websockets could 
    open the doors for some cool web stuff.

    Also the more protocols I support the more likely `blewis` is to be actually used by a real human... Providing that
    it's not total dog ðŸ’©.

4) Have different mediums of storage **Undecided**
    Redis does support persistence in the form of dumping the dataset to disk periodically or by appending each cmd to a
    disk-based log. These are excellent features and wondering whether to expand on them a little more, adding other 
    storage mediums as options, as opposed to just persisting in-memory storage. 

5) Use the tracing crate to provide good logging and metrics
    I want to learn the tracing crate anyway and this seems like the perfect project to do so. 

# The things I'm not looking to do (at least not right away)

- Full blown query language
- Scripting / functions
- Pub / sub
- build a proper CLI 
- Any kind of GUI
