# Overview

This is a simple web backend & frontend that is used to showcase how I'd embed a webserver into a standalone binary. This
could be useful for things like internal tools, which may need a quick-n-dirty GUI.

If I was deploying a proper backend to support customer-facing tools, I'd make very different choices. 

# Skills shown
